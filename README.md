# python_recursive_functions
Demonstration of Recursive Functions in Python

Requirements:
* is_power function takes two arguments.
* is_power function call is_divisible .
* is_power function call itself recursively.
* is_power function include code for the base case of the two arguments being equal.
* is_power function include code for the base case of the second argument being "1".

Assumptions:
* Program may assume that both arguments to is_power are positive integers. Note that the only positive integer
that is a power of "1" is "1" itself.
